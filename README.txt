This program provides a Feedback page for LibreOffice.

Description
-----------

LibreOffice (and other FOSS) projects can benefit from having a single
destination for users who wish to leave feedback. Feedback might come
in several forms including:

* Bug reports
* Well wishes
* General complaints
* Enhancement requests
* User-support questions
* Questions about the project

This Feedback page hopes to provide users with links to

* Bugzilla
* Ask LibreOffice
* Some generic feedback mechanism (Feedback form or mailing list)
